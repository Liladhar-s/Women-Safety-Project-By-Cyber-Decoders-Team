# Women-Safety-Project-By-Cyber-Decoders-Team
The women’s safety application will aim at providing the utmost safety to women. All they need to do is register themselves on the application and as soon as they sense something shady, they’ll press the power button thrice, and consequently, their location will be sent to the nearest police station and emergency contacts. If the woman reaches a safe space, she can press the stop button. This will have three modules-   Admin module that will manage the application, view the user details, and track the location. User module will be used by the women registered on the application. After registering themselves users would need to add details like emergency contacts, location etc.  Guardian module will be the well-wishers of the users. They will also have to register on the application. This application would have a shake detector, which that means on shaking the device, SOS messages will be sent to registered contact numbers. It will also send the last known location with a google map link to registered contacts.  Tools/languages required – Android Studio IDE, Xampp, Android SDK, Android Emulator, Java, and basic XML, Firebase authentication, and real-time database.
